# library
Simple library without error handling or styling.
I challenged myself with creating almost everything through JS.
It was fuuuuun!

However, it also was a huge challenge. At first it seemed simple and straightforward, but it got really complicated when I had to target specific elements of the DOM.

I decided to not focus on styling that much - just pure logic. Recently I've been spending a lot of my time on CSS so I think it's time for JS. 
And... I don't have enough time because of work... So yeah, I had to sacrifice CSS... But just for now!!

I'll be back!

(I know there is a lot of repetition... I'll fix this soon.)
